\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame or data.table containing response data. Each event of response has to be defined in an own row.
Data for Response type, durable response, ongoing treatment and treatmend end have to entered in the respective columns.}

\item{ID}{column name that contains subject IDs.}

\item{end}{column name that contains time after which the subject died or was lost to follow-up.}

\item{response.start}{column that contains time after index date (e.g. diagnosis, treatment start) with documented response.}

\item{response.end}{column that contains time after index date with documented end of response.}

\item{response.type}{column that contains information whether patient had complete or partial response.}

\item{stack.groups}{logical value indicating whether subjects should only be sorted by time or also stacked into groups defined by the strat argument. Default is TRUE.}

\item{continued.response}{column that contains (logical) value whether response is ongoing or not.}

\item{durable.response}{column containing (logical) value whether response was durable (equal to or longer than six months).}

\item{strat}{grouping factor. Color of bars are colored accordingly.}

\item{symbol.size}{size of symbols indicating response types}

\item{xlab}{label of x-axis}

\item{ylab}{label of y-axis}
